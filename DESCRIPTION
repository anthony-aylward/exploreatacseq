Description:
    `exploreatacseq` provides methods for exploratory analysis of multiple
    ATAC-seq datasets, which might represent multiple cell types or
    treatment conditions. The primary function is `explore()`, which takes as
    input a set of BAM files containing data from bulk or single-cell ATAC-seq
    experiments, along with some metadata for each file. Each ATAC-seq dataset
    is pre-processed and normalized, and then a principal component analysis
    is performed. The output of `explore()` is a table of PC coordinates for
    each input file along with a customizable PCA plot.
